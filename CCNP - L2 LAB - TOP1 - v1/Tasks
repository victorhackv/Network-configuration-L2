Training CCNP/CCIE Encore - Exam 350-401
Tasks
Switches in the WARDI COORP may be partially configured, it's your responsibility to validate and complete the configurations.

Part 1 - VTP
The VTP domain must be KALAU;
SW1 should be the VTP server, the others should be clients;
Use VTP version 2;
All VTP updates must be secured using MD5 encryption using the string K@l@u;
To minimize unknown unicast flooding on all VLANs, it has been requested that any dynamically learned entries on distribution switches be retained for 3 hours.

Part 2 - Access Ports
All unused ports should be configured in VLAN 999 and administratively shut down;
Access ports should transition to the forwarding state as soon as the link comes up, while not receiving any BPDU. Use only one command per switch to enable this feature;
Access ports should automatically be shut down if they receive any BPDU;
VLAN 911 (10.2.1.X/24) will be used as the management VLAN, ensure all switches can ping each other in this network;
No switch should generate TCN when an access port goes down;
Ports that have been shut down should automatically recover in 10 minutes;
Only allow necessary VLANs on trunks;
If a root port fails, the alternate port should immediately transition to the forwarding state;
BPDUs received on SW5 access ports should filter all BPDUs;
Configure the switch ports in their respective VLANs;

Part 3 - Trunk Ports
All links between switches should explicitly disable dynamic trunk negotiation;
All links between switches should use 4-byte encapsulation;
SW1 should be the root for VLANs 10, 20, and 999 and backup root for VLANs 30, 40, and 911;
SW2 should be the root for VLANs 30, 40, and 911 and backup root for VLANs 10, 20, and 999;

Part 4 - Link Bundling
Links between core and distribution should maintain a single L2 link and use a proprietary Cisco protocol for negotiation;
Switches 3 and 4 should always initiate negotiation;
Links between distribution switches should maintain a single L2 link and use an open protocol for negotiation;
Links between CORE switches should maintain a single L3 link, use an open protocol for negotiation (use the IPs provided in the topology), and both should initiate negotiation;
Distribution switches should balance traffic between all members of the link based on the source and destination IP address;
Core switches should balance incoming traffic between all members of the link based on the MAC address;

Part 5 - Security
Disable CDP only on ports with connected hosts.
